# 🧑‍⚖️ Legal Document Intelligence using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 📘 Overview

This project develops an **AI-powered legal assistant** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to efficiently retrieve and generate insights from large collections of legal documents.
It aims to help **legal professionals** quickly find relevant clauses, analyze contracts, and answer complex legal questions with precision and context.

By combining **domain-specific retrieval** with **LLM-based reasoning**, the system enhances **accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **decision-making** in legal document analysis.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

Legal firms and departments manage **large volumes of complex legal documents**, such as:

* Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
* Merger and Acquisition (M&A) contracts
* Privacy Policies
* Confidentiality Agreements

Manually searching through these documents is **time-consuming and error-prone**.
The goal of this project is to build a **RAG-based pipeline** that:

1. Retrieves the most relevant legal excerpts from a corpus.
2. Generates accurate and contextualized answers to user queries.
3. Provides explainability by showing **source document references**.

This system empowers legal professionals to:

* Save time on document review
* Improve research accuracy
* Accelerate due diligence and compliance workflows

## 🧠 Dataset Details

| Folder          | Description                                                           | Type of Documents                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **contractnli** | Legal agreements for confidentiality and NDAs                         | Legal reasoning, clause extraction |
| **cuad**        | Contracts annotated with legal clauses (e.g., termination, liability) | Clause-level annotation            |
| **maud**        | Merger & acquisition documents                                        | Corporate legal documents          |
| **privacy_qa**  | Privacy policy question-answer dataset                                | QA pairs for compliance policies   |

Each folder corresponds to an **evaluation JSON file** in the `benchmark` directory, containing:

* `questions`
* `answers`
* `document_sources`

## ⚙️ Problem Statement

Develop a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework that can:

1. **Retrieve** the most relevant legal passages from the corpus for a given query.
2. **Generate** coherent, contextually accurate responses.
3. **Evaluate** performance using the provided benchmark datasets.

---

## 🧩 Solution Architecture

### 🔍 1. Retrieval Layer

* Indexes the corpus using **vector embeddings** (e.g., `sentence-transformers`, `OpenAI embeddings`, or `Faiss`).
* Performs **semantic search** to fetch top-k relevant passages for a query.

### 🧾 2. Generation Layer

* Uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, or similar) to generate answers.
* Contextualizes retrieved text and provides references to source documents.

### ⚖️ 3. Evaluation Layer

* Compares generated answers to benchmark answers using:

  * **ROUGE / BLEU / F1** for similarity
  * **Retrieval Precision@K** for retrieval performance

---

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**

   * Clean and tokenize text files from the corpus.
   * Build a vector index for retrieval.

2. **Query Handling**

   * Input a legal question.
   * Retrieve top relevant passages using embeddings.

3. **Answer Generation**

   * Feed retrieved text + query into the LLM.
   * Generate a concise and factual answer.

4. **Evaluation**

   * Compare results against benchmark JSON datasets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Python ≥ 3.9
* `pip` or `conda` for package management
* Access to an embedding model and LLM API (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-rag-system.git
cd legal-rag-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Starter Notebook

Open the starter notebook to explore dataset structure and baseline retrieval:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/starter_notebook.ipynb
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric           | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision@K**  | Fraction of relevant documents among top-K retrieved        |
| **Recall@K**     | Fraction of total relevant documents retrieved              |
| **ROUGE / BLEU** | Measures similarity between generated and reference answers |
| **Latency (ms)** | Time taken for end-to-end query resolution                  |

---

## 🧱 Example Use Case

**User Query:**

> “Does this agreement include a non-compete clause?”

**RAG System Output:**
✅ **Answer:**

> “Yes, Section 5.3 of the agreement restricts the employee from engaging with competitors for a period of 12 months post-termination.”

📄 **Source:** `contractnli/nda_agreement_07.txt`

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integrate **legal ontology graphs** for better semantic retrieval
* Add **explainability module** to trace evidence for generated outputs
* Implement **multi-document summarization** for contract comparison
* Deploy as an **interactive web app** (using LangChain + Streamlit)
